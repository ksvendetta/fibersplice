# Fiber Optic Cable Splicing Management Application

## Overview

This application is a professional fiber optic cable splicing management tool for tracking circuits within fiber cables. It features a checkbox-based system for marking circuits as spliced, allowing users to create cables with specific fiber counts, define circuit IDs with auto-calculated fiber positions, and manage splice connections. The system aims to simplify the process of fiber optic cable management with a focus on automatic matching and industry-standard visualizations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:** React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for fast development.
**State Management:** TanStack Query for server state, React Hook Form with Zod for form validation.
**UI Component System:** Shadcn UI (New York style) based on Radix UI, Tailwind CSS with a custom HSL-based color system, Material Design principles adapted for industrial use.
**Design System Highlights:** Dark mode primary interface (deep navy-charcoal), professional blue primary color, exact HSL color specifications for fiber optic standard colors (12 colors: blue, orange, green, brown, slate, white, red, black, yellow, violet, pink, aqua), Inter and JetBrains Mono typography, responsive spacing.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript for RESTful API endpoints.
**API Design:** RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on cables and circuits (`/api/cables`, `/api/circuits`).
**Circuit Operations:** Includes `PATCH /api/circuits/:id/toggle-spliced` to update splice status and map feed cable information.
**Validation:** Zod schemas derived from Drizzle ORM.
**Development & Production Modes:** Vite middleware for development, static file serving for production.

### Data Storage Solutions

**ORM & Schema Management:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL operations, schema-first approach with Drizzle-Zod integration.
**Database Schema:**
- **Cables Table:** `id` (UUID), `name`, `fiberCount`, `ribbonSize` (12), `type` ("Feed" or "Distribution").
- **Circuits Table:** `cableId`, `circuitId`, `position`, `fiberStart`, `fiberEnd`, `isSpliced` (0/1), `feedCableId` (UUID, nullable), `feedFiberStart` (nullable), `feedFiberEnd` (nullable).
- UUID primary keys, cascade deletion for cables and associated circuits.
**Storage Abstraction:** `IStorage` interface with `DatabaseStorage` implementation using Drizzle ORM.

### System Design Choices & Features

**Database Persistence:** Full PostgreSQL integration, all data persists, automatic schema migrations with Drizzle Kit.
**Checkbox-Based Splicing with Automatic Range-Based Circuit Matching:**
- Simple checkbox to mark Distribution circuits as spliced, automatically searching all Feed cables for a matching circuit using range-based matching.
- **Range-Based Matching Logic:** Distribution circuit matches a Feed circuit if (1) both have the same prefix (part before comma), and (2) the Distribution circuit's numeric range from the circuit ID is within the Feed circuit's numeric range from the circuit ID.
- **Important:** Matching uses the numeric range from the circuit ID itself (e.g., "test,3-4" extracts 3-4), NOT the physical fiber positions in the cable.
- **Example:** Distribution circuit "test,3-4" matches Feed circuit "test,1-12" because prefix "test" matches and range 3-4 is within 1-12.
- **Example:** Distribution circuit "exact,15-20" matches Feed circuit "exact,15-20" (exact match where 15-20 equals 15-20).
- Automatically extracts Feed cable ID and fiber positions for one-click splicing.
- Stores `feedCableId`, `feedFiberStart`, `feedFiberEnd` in the circuits table (Distribution circuit's actual fiber range, not Feed range).
- Error handling with toast messages if no matching Feed circuit is found.
- Splice tab displays individual fiber mappings (one row per fiber) with color-coded, industry-standard fiber optic colors (12 colors).
**Pass/Fail Status Badges:** Cables and circuits display green "Pass" badges when total assigned fibers are within cable capacity, or red "Fail" badges when exceeded.
**Delete Cable:** Immediate deletion without confirmation dialog.
**Circuit ID Management (Auto-Calculated Fiber Positions with Edit and Reorder):**
- Simplified input: `circuitId` is the only required input.
- Inline editing of circuit IDs with automatic recalculation of fiber positions.
- Circuit reordering with arrow buttons, triggering automatic recalculation of fiber positions.
- Auto-calculation of fiber positions based on circuit order.
- Real-time validation for fiber count matching cable capacity.
- Visual feedback on assigned/total fiber count.
**User Interface:**
- Two main tabs: **InputData** (cable and circuit management) with Cable icon, and **Splice** (splice mappings) with Workflow icon.
- InputData tab features cable list, cable details, circuit management, and splice checkboxes.
- Splice tab features a three-row header with "Feed" and "Distribution" sections and detailed, color-coded individual fiber mapping.
- **Label Usage:** Cable details section shows "Cable Size: X", Circuit management header shows "Fiber Count: X/Y" (X assigned out of Y total).
- **Pass/Fail Status:** Both cable cards and circuit details use consistent logic (assigned fibers ≤ cable capacity = Pass, assigned > capacity = Fail).
- Responsive design with a professional technical interface.
